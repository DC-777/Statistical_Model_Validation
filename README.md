# Statistical_Model_Validation
This repository contains original data files for energy modeling using Support Vector Machine Regression. This predicted data from the model was compared with the actual data so as to analyze the limitations and advantages of various statistical performance metrics. The link to the published paper will be provided later. The source code for the project will be uploaded later.
